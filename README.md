Welcome to the GitHub repo for my Personal Website!

## Where can I find this magical website?
Great question! To visit my personal website, please click [here](https://mattgrantumich.github.io).

## What will I find once I'm there?

### About
The about tab will tell you a little about me from a professional side. This includes information about my work experience, personal project experience, education, and a whole lot more. You'll be able to see what languages and tools I'm familiar with, and even see my hours spent coding using WakaTime.

### Vinyl
That's right, there's a tab dedicated to my Vinyl collection! It's pretty neat. You'll be able to see both what's in my current Vinyl collection, and what I have on my wantlist. This will be updated from time to time automatically, as I have configured a GitHub Action to pull data from Discogs, and interpret it in a reactive manner.

### My Spotify
This tab will give you a small taste of my Spotify playlists. Spotify is just one of the tools I've used for my own personal musical immersion and discovery, and I will periodically be updating the playlists you'll find there, so feel free to check in now and then!

### Gallery
Here you will find photo galleries I have put together from the various places I have travelled in the past. I will be updating this from time to time as I travel around, which will be occurring quite a bit in the distant future once it is safe to do so (keeping COVID-19 in mind).

### Blog
My opinions and ramblings are certainly nonsense, but hey I still like to make an article here and there! Over time I'm sure the posts will get better, probably...

### Contact Me
Here you will be able to contact me! And please feel free to, as I will read the message through and through, and maybe even send you a message back containing a picture of Jason Schwartzman, cause he's a real cool guy.

## What's in it for me?
I will think you're a really cool person. And I'll give you a high five, virtually at least.
