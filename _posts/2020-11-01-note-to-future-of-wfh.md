For many of those in the tech industry, as we enter the now eigth month of working from home, I think it is a good idea to reflect a bit on the concept of working from home as a whole.

## A Note
Before continuing, I just want to make mention that I am in support of working from home during this global pandemic, and staying as safe and isolated as possible. This is more just my thoughts on the future of this concept when it is 100% safe to go back to the office.


# The Beginning
When the global pandemic first came about, and working from home quickly became the norm, it was quite a chaotic time. For many companies, organizations, schools, etc., every form of the average work day needed to have a virtual transition. Systems needed to be put in place to make it so meetings could still occur, work could still be collaborated on, and progress could continue. There was a bit of action that needed to be taken relatively quickly.

However, like with many systems over 8 months of execution, people seem to have gotten the hang of things. Besides accidentally leaving your mic muted while talking, or the occassional dropout of internet, there seems to be a bit of consistency in the workday as if we weren't all at home.

What does this mean? Well, it seems that some companies, mainly large tech companies, are realizing the potential this has for the future. Screw the office, lets just stay online through the company! Yes, of course there can be benefits to this, but this terrifies me.

# A Different Lens
Look, I absolutely love that I can roll out of bed 10 minutes before my daily standup call. Not having to walk to the office in the oncoming Michigan winter is something I am very much looking forward to. Being able to play a really quick game of NHL 21 on my lunch break is quite the plus. You may have your own list of positives that comes out of this (assuming COVID-19 == null); however, if it maps pretty well to my list, indulge me as we take a deeper dive.

Let's say it is 100% safe to be in the office, and COVID is no longer a concern. Practicly every reason on my list to want to work from home can have a strong counter point.
- ***"I absolutely love that I can roll out of bed 10 minutes before my daily standup call"***
  - The days I wake up an hour and a half or two before starting work are some of my most productive. Not having this crutch would be excellent for my personal progress.
- ***"Not having to walk to the office in the oncoming Michigan winter is something I am very much looking forward to"***
  - The walk is about a mile, meaning I get 10 miles of walking in a week just for going to the office!
- ***"Being able to play a really quick game of NHL 21 on my lunch break is quite the plus"***
  - Well yes, I suppose that is rather fun, but Matt Grant can play NHL 21 after work!

As you can see, a lot of the reasons just resolve to additions to my lazy tendencies. Now, this is not to say there is no validity in any item you may have on your list of course. However, take a look at your list with a different lens. Perhaps going back into the office once we're able to safely again is truly the best option! That being said, it should remain an option for all employees when we have progressed past COVID-19.

# I Miss My Fellow Co-Workers!
In my mind, seeing stories about how after COVID is no longer a looming threat companies may just move to mostly remote has made me very scared. I think if there's even a drop of enthusiasm for it, companies will go for it gladly. And assuming going to the office is optional, you would find a mostly empty office with the people like me who have been dying to get back to a desk away from home.

Why would I care if others are there? Well, this makes me sound (and definitely makes me) selfish, but it improves my output. But I'd like to make a larger point that I think it improves the output of the company in general. Knowing that I can go right outside my door and have a conversation with a Customer Support Team member or a Customer Success Manager gives me quite a boost as opposed to a Slack call. Why? Well, I think we can all agree on the fact that troubleshooting a problem with a co-worker is much more efficient when in person; however, also seeing someone face to face that cares a great amount about the mission of the company, about improving the products, about considering the clients, it kind of puts a deeper meaning to work you produce. To me, that's part of the magic when writing code. That's the magic of Company Culture in the office.

# The Company/Office Culture
Company Culture has quite an importance, and I think it has a great risk of being slashed with the future of remote working. Now, people may make the argument that Company Culture is built through meetings and events outside the office, which can happen still in a completely remote enviorment. However, I disagree on both. Company Culture is built through the quick chats you have together on your way back to your desk, the whiteboard planning sessions you have in the conference room, and the off-topic rants you have together after work over a beer. Company Culture is built by being your real self with your co-worker's real self.

On the topic of events outside the office, they should be seen as addatives to the already built Company Culture, not the building blocks for it. If you don't have that in-office built culture already, there's really little to no motivation to go to these exterior company events, unless its an event like attending a ball game "as a company" where you don't really even interact with each other. For example, recently I hosted a GeoCaching event outdoors for our company and it was an absolute blast. However, that's a pretty interaction-heavy event, which would be really odd to do with people who I've only talked to on a few weekly meetings before. You have to build there co-worker relationships within the workplace so they can help bring positivity not only in the company's work, but also outside of the office.

Here's an example I think everyone can relate to. Imagine watching NBC's The Office, except every prank Jim pulls on Dwight is something along the lines of changing his default settings to have his camera turn on when eentering a call. You think those two would end up as close as they did by the end of the series? I THINK NOT! Case closed.

# Final Thoughts
Perhaps you enjoy working from home and are looking forward to doing that for the rest of your career; however, let me just voice my cautious opinion to you. If it is feasible for you to be in the office, I think it is better for both you, and your organization, to do so. It could prevent you from growing on lazy tendencies, increase positivity in your life, and improve your output at your organization. To me, that's pretty good.

All I can close out with is that I hope the move to being fully remote is one that doesn't actually happen. I hope the companies looking into this transition consider all the effects this may have on not on the Company Culture, but also the general productivity of the organization. Until then, we shall have to wait and see.
