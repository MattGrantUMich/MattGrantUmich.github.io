It is not often that I read in my free time, but this book has helped me start getting more into reading again. Not because it encourages people to read within its content; rather, this is due to it being a pretty interesting read.

My goal with this post isn't to go into the contents of this book, but rather the output it has produced for me specifically. Essentially this book is nothing more than a black box where:
- Input => Me
- Output => Better Me
Which I guess is truly the purpose of books like these. Anyway, let's dive in.

# Overthinking

If anyone knows me well enough, there's one thing they certainly know and that is that I overthink just about anything. This ranges from decisions in my relationships all way down to where to grab a sandwhich from for lunch. This overthinking was becoming not only a time suck for me, but a life suck. It was essentially a drain on my mind, which I knew even while I was doing it to myself.

Funny how that works, huh? It seems trivial to just say "hey, you literally see the issue, so don't do that"; however, as trivial as it sounds, that ain't an easy fix, partner.

There's this concept in the book called the Feedback Loophole from Hell. Essentially, you start thinking about doing whatever, then you think about the routes that occur if you do it or don't do it, then you think of the routes that come from that, then you flip flop your decision, then you go crazy, then you burst. It's pretty great.

As a developer, you'd think I'd just go into my personal code and find the recursive loop and fix the issue, but it took a lot of debugging to crack it. Turns out this book provides some simple tips for getting out of this loop. Essentially, it teaches you to stop giving a hoot about these trivial decisions. You end up making yourself a whole lot less stressed if you don't overthink it and just go with what you're initially thinking about.

If you're worried about what sandwhich to get for lunch, just choose the first one that comes to mind, cause they're all probably pretty good if they made your final decision list, and there are many more lunches out to be had in the future.

If you're worried about asking someone out, don't analyze the situation for four weeks, just do it or don't. What's the worst that's gonna happen, they say no and it's kind of awkward? Bwah.

If you're worried about bringing up an issue to your higher up, don't overthink things and stress yourself even further, just bring it up, as they will probably be more appreciative that you brought it up instead of keeping it to yourself all bottled up.

If you're worried about which job to take, well yea that's a bit different, take some time weighing out the options, but don't put yourself in an infinite loop deciding which option to take.

As you can see, there are a variety of situations which are relevant to many of us, many of which I have put myself in the Feedback loophole from Hell through. Now, I certainly have some ways to go with fixing this issue, but this book helped me take some giant steps. Ever since letting go of most these stresses around overthinking, I have saved myself from worrying a great deal about issues that don't, and won't, even exist. As it turns out, without this added stress, I was able to be much more productive with my time and much more motivated with my goals. What a concept!

# I Was Just Trying to Help!

Another common scenario I put myself in was when I would try to map a situation in such a way that benefits the other part(ies) involved rather than myself, essentially attempting to take their responsibilities into my own hands, which I viewed as helpful. Turns out, as obvious as this seems, people don't want you to take on their personal responsibilities, whether they be tangible or emotional. Rather, they want you to support them, and there's a distinct difference between those two things.

Each responsibility someone has is something each individual strives to handle, manage, or even conquer. It's accomplishments that come from successes in these responsibilities that keep all of us motivated and sane. If you try to reach out a helping hand past a point of what someone is asking for help with, you might accedentially reach to far.

An example I'd pull into play is the episode of Parks and Rec where all Ann Perkins wants is a Chris that listens to her issues and supports her through them. Rather, she has a Chris who is super proactive in trying to solve all the problems she has before she can even mention 'em. As shown through the episode, this did not sit well with Ann, who essentially burst towards the end of the episode to other characters in the show. Now of course, this is a bit of a dramatized version of this situation, but it isn't to far off from what this situation in reality is like.

One of the issues specifically I had in this specific setup is I would do what I feel is helpful (wrong version of helpful), and when I did not see improvement in the situation, I would assume I needed to add more help powder to the mixture. It's like a different variation of the loophole from hell. You convince yourself of something, see negative results, but then question if it's what you're doing or if you're just not doing enough of it. Eventually, you just burst yourself and, uh, yeah, not good.

The way this book puts this kind of thinking is pretty interesting. The author essentially claims this behavior as a form of entitlement. Who are you to try and take on the responsibilities of others, did they ask you to? Nay. Nay nay nay. And that actually clicked for me a bit. Yea, in my mind I was very much like "yes, this is a great thing I am doing, go me!". That should've been the point of self-realization when I said "wait, who am I doing this for, me, or them?". Cause once you stop giving a crap about what you are doing for yourself in that situation and give more a crap what you are doing for them, you've moved from being entitled to being a supporter. That's just bliss.

Much like the solutions I built from this book in the section above, I still have much work to do in this category, but this book was great for pointing to examples of the right and wrong ways of being a helpful, caring, and truly courteous person.

# Final Thoughts

Now I could go into the many other points I analyzed and worked with through reading this book, but I just wanted to point out these two specific topics.

If you are like me who is anxious at all and/or overthinks the smallest things in life, I would 1000% give this book a read. It provides a number of examples throughout the book which shed light on the results that come from worrying this much about everything in life. To me, it was essentially another person telling me "Stop that!", but this time slapping me in the face with cold, hard evidence of my issue and steps to help it.

Overall, 9.5/10 for this one folks.
