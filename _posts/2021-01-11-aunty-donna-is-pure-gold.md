# I Think You Should Preface
Before jumping into the headliner of this post, I want to rewind the tapes real quick. Now, it's probably likely that you have never heard of Aunty Donna's Big Ol’ House of Fun; however, I’d put a dollar on the fact that you’ve seen at least a clip or even an image from Tim Robinson’s I Think You Should Leave.

I Think You Should Leave is a new form of a Skit show. Taking the high production level we see throughout the other hit TV series of today and pairing it with the Tim Robinson sketches they wouldn’t do on SNL, I mean that’s gonna something legendary there. It’s witty in its humor, quick with its one-liners, and never lets one bit go on too long. You’re basically entertained the entire time during this first season of just six episodes on Netflix.

Now, that season has been out for a while now, and though it took some time, it has amassed a rather large cult following. I mean, I am a slightly active member in the (un)official I Think You Should Leave sh*t-posting page on Facebook, so I think I’m basically in. No but in all seriousness, this show is the perfect show for those who are extremely bit heavy, especially with their friends, which happens to be me.

I can only imagine the major success of this high quality, sketch-based show caught the eyes of some groups. Specifically one Australian absurdist comedy group.

# Aunty Donna
Aunty Donna is a comedy group from Melbourne. Its main members are Mark Samual Bonanno, Broden Kelly, and Zachary Ruane. They grew to popularity through YouTube, gaining around 400,000 subscribers as of late 2020. I’ve watched a few of these videos, and they’re pretty well done, and follow the same humor you’ll find in the show. They we’re of pretty high quality and pretty witty humor, it’s no wonder they started to try to move beyond YouTube.

Here’s the thing though, the first approach seemed to be going live, and lemme tell ya... it doesn’t translate as well. A huge aspect of the humor portrayed in these brilliant acts is the perfectly timed punchlines, the style of the shots, and the lack of an audience. Actually, to that last point, they allude to that point in the final episode of their first season. A live show with Aunty Donna is still good, but it strays a bit off the path of their excellence seen at the YouTube level.

So what could they do then to get this fantastic product to more viewers? Here come’s Tim Robinson, in all his glory, with the answer. Netflix, the big leagues.

# A Big Ol' House of Fun
Alright, I’m just gonna rant right now about just how perfect this show is. If Tim Robinson’s I Think You Should Leave is an A+ (which it is), then Aunty Donna’s Big Ol’ House of Fun is an A++. I will start by saying if you are looking at this and saying, “well I should determine this myself”, I encourage it with the slight note that it is gonna be weird, but I promise it is amazing.

The main point I would make to sum up this series’ excellence is this: flow. I have never seen a show built with such a clean, yet subtle flow. They can switch from one bit, to another, to another, all within a minute, and you would have no idea. But here’s the thing, each one of those unique bits is gonna get you laughing about it at some point or another.

** SPOILERS AHEAD (I guess?) **

Perhaps the best example of this flow is from the point of the title sequence in Episode 1 to the next Aunty Donna graphic is displayed. Let’s recount the order of bits that all occur without any other transitions really needed:
- Zach changes Wifi name to "poopoo"
- Jerry Seinfeld drops by
- Aunty Donna members all rip their Mark posters
- Poster Season at the Poster Shop
- Zach's thought bubble

It's genius, all these bits feel so closed to themselves and so filled with content, yet this is a flowing story from start to finish. Each one of these above points has about 10 golden lines in each of them, and they're not forced or poorly executed. Matter fact, it's all perfectly executed.

Their ability to incorporate various bits across the same episode, the entire series (Egg Helms, mannequin dumping, etc) is unreal. I could watch this season over and over again, and for this reason specifically I have prevented myself from watching it for a while to preserve its greatness.

If you haven’t seen this show, or I Think You Should Leave, you need to go watch both of them like right now. This blog is terrible, these shows are amazing, you’ll get such a better deal.
