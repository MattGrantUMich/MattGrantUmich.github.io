    I hope ya like Neil Cicierega, because I am likely going to be adding
    a lot of recommendations from this musical genius. Cabinet Man is one
    of my favorite of his bops, and the reason extends past its very catchy
    chorus. It's the story. Before listening to this song, I never heard of
    Polybius. It ended up being a conspiracy/rabbit hole I entered which I was
    more and more excited to read about. Of course, the story of this track doesn't
    map literally to that of Polybius, but I highly you suggest looking into the
    magical, mysterious game before listening to this masterpiece!

    If you have a fever, and the only prescription is more Soul and good vibes, well
    then do I have the medicine for you! The reason I linked this entire EP is because
    it is all around phenomenal. The quality of each track is up there for me when it
    comes to music that has been released these past few months. I could code, run, game,
    or even just relax to this music. It's an all-around hit for me, and I hope Qur'an Shaheed
    is able to blossom, because this music is really well put together. Give it a listen!

    Oh yea, you know if Vulfpeck has a track up on SoundCloud, it's gonna be on this list.
    Known for their absolutely funk-tastic beats, and groovy melodies, Vulfpeck put this
    beaut up on SoundCloud not long after The Beautiful Game. It happens to be a different
    take on Dean Town, which is to no surprise, due to the beauty that Dean Town brought.
    If you haven't heard that one, give it a listen first. Talk about a baseline! Once you're
    done there, come on back here and make sure you keep on your dancing shoes, unless they aren't
    already on of course, but that'd be strange after some Dean Town. Funky funky.
